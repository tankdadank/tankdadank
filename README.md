# More About Me

Im a software developer focused on building systems that are structured, maintainable, and intentional.

My primary passion project is **Cardian**, a Discord based card game platform designed around fairness, transparency, and long term stability.

I prefer depth over speed, clarity over cleverness, and shipping things that feel finished rather than rushed.

## Projects

Cardian is a system driven Discord card game platform built to feel reliable, predictable, and fair rather than noisy or gimmicky.

The project focuses on:
- Button driven gameplay over command spam
- Strict game state enforcement
- Clear separation between ranked and non ranked modes
- Anti farming and integrity safeguards
- Transparency through a companion website
